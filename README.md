# 2018_scWorkshop

Thank you for attending this workshop. The hope of this workshop is to prepare a researcher to perform initial analysis in scRNA-Seq. This workshop tries to not only explain how to perform some tasks in code but also tries to give a solid foundation for learning.

Feel free to contact me at ttickle@broadinstitute.org.

The agenda to this workshop can be found at [this repo's wiki](https://github.com/TimothyTickle/2018_scWorkshop/wiki)

Happy Science!
